title: Integrative Personal Omics Profiles during Periods of Weight Gain and Loss
published: true
---

I will be starting my journey in this journal club-like blog with this article that is presented in CNPN(Canadian National Proteomics Network) 2018 Symposium  by Hannes RÓ§st from University of Toronto. The reason I selected this paper to be my first in this page, is because it's quite extensive and contains set of really great analysis techniques for bioinformatics for different omics data.

**Abstract:** "Advances in omics technologies now allow an unprecedented level of phenotyping for human diseases, including obesity, in which individual responses to excess weight are heterogeneous and unpredictable. To aid the development of better understanding of these phenotypes, we performed a controlled longitudinal weight perturbation study combining multiple omics strategies (genomics, transcriptomics, multiple proteomics assays, metabolomics, and microbiomics) during periods of weight gain and loss in humans. **Results** demonstrated that: **(1) weight gain is associated with the activation of strong inflammatory and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy signatures in blood; (2) although weight loss reverses some changes, a number of signatures persist, indicative of long-term physio- logic changes; (3) we observed omics signatures associated with insulin resistance that may serve as novel diagnostics; (4) specific biomolecules were highly individualized and stable in response to perturbations, potentially representing stable personalized markers.** Most data are available open access and serve as a valuable resource for the community."


## Introduction


- The statistics of obesity in US (34%) and the deaths caused by it worldwide (3 million) are powerful reason to gain a better understanding of the factors contributing to obesity-associated morbidities; cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
